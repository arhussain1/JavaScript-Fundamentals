This repo covers the beginning of my JavaScript journey. We will begin by going through the JavaScript basics from Makers Academy. 

#### Steps taken to set up my project folder
- begin by installing node, this will be used as our REPL throughout this project where I can test code and ensure my program is running correctly.
- The install jest, this is our testing software just like RSpec for Ruby. This will allow me to Test Drive any project.

##### First project
We need to testdrive a simple function called **add** which will take two numbers as arguments and add them together.

The Learning Objectives for this are:
  - [ ] To Test-Drive a simple function using jest
  - [ ] To be able to export a function using module.exports
  - [ ] To be able to require that 'exported' function in another file
  - [ ] To run a test suite using jest
