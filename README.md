This repo covers the beginning of my JavaScript journey. We will begin by going through the JavaScript basics from Makers Academy. 

### Steps taken to set up my project folder
- begin by installing node, this will be used as our REPL throughout this project where I can test code and ensure my program is running correctly.
- The install jest, this is our testing software just like RSpec for Ruby. This will allow me to Test Drive any project.

#### First project
We need to testdrive a simple function called **add** which will take two numbers as arguments and add them together.

The Learning Objectives for this are:
  - [x] To Test-Drive a simple function using jest
  - [x] To be able to export a function using module.exports
  - [x] To be able to require that 'exported' function in another file
  - [x] To run a test suite using jest

#### Second Project - FizzBuzz
We created a fizzbuzz function earlier, we now need to use jest to create tests to ensure it's working correctly.

The Learning Objectives for this are:
  - [ ] complete all the Learning objectives from the previous project but for the FizzBuzz function.

  Criteria to test for:
  - it should return "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 (e.g 3 or 9)
  - it should return "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 (e.g 5 or 10)
  - it should return "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 15 (e.g 15 or 30)
  - it should just return the number the number is otherwise
